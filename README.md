## Project Structure

Hereâ€™s a brief overview of the project structure:

- `index.js`: The main entry point of the application. It sets up the Express server, configures middleware, and starts the server.
- `db.js`: Contains the logic for connecting to the MongoDB database using Mongoose.
- `.env.clone`: A template for the `.env` file containing environment variables.

---

## Additional Notes

- Ensure that your MongoDB instance is running and accessible from your application.
- For further customization, you can modify the middleware settings, routes, and other configurations as per your requirements.
