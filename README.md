This repository provides a template for setting up a backend server using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB.

---

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- npm (Node package manager, comes with Node.js)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

## Quick Start

1. **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/smitneu3009/Backend-template.git
    cd backend-template
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. **Set Up Environment Variables:**

    - Copy the `.env.clone` file to `.env`:

        ```bash
        cp .env.clone .env
        ```

    - Open the `.env` file and replace the placeholders with your actual values:

        ```plaintext
        # MongoDB connection URL
        MONGODB_URL= " "  # Replace this with your MongoDB connection URL. You can find this URL in your MongoDB Atlas dashboard. Navigate to your cluster, click "Connect", and then choose "Connect your application". Copy the provided connection string.

        # Application port
        PORT=8000
        ```

4. **Run the Application:**

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

## Project Structure

Hereâ€™s a brief overview of the project structure:

- `index.js`: The main entry point of the application. It sets up the Express server, configures middleware, and starts the server.
- `db.js`: Contains the logic for connecting to the MongoDB database using Mongoose.
- `.env.clone`: A template for the `.env` file containing environment variables.

---

## Additional Notes

- Ensure that your MongoDB instance is running and accessible from your application.
- For further customization, you can modify the middleware settings, routes, and other configurations as per your requirements.
